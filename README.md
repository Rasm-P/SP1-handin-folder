# This is the readme.md file for my-handin-folder and the attached DAT3.semester weekly assignments.


# 01-tuesday-exercises
All steps of the exercise were completed as written in the assignment.

The solution for exercises "JPA with NetBeans(my first java-JPA application) 1-7 & JPA With a Facade 1-2" can 
be found under the "01-tuesday-exercises" folder as the project "ExerciseOne".

The solution for exercise "EX-1 JPA, Entity Classes, transaction and cool JPA-Queries" can be found under the 
"01-tuesday-exercises" folder as the project "point".

The solution for exercises "Ex-2 Continued - Adding a facade & Ex-3  Add a JUnit Test to your facade" can be 
found under the "01-tuesday-exercises" folder as the project "ExerciseTwo".

The solutions for these exercises covered the basics for ORM frameworks and JPA with annotations for persistence 
of entities in a database. In connection with this we also learned the usage of terms like EntityManager, EntityManagerFactory 
and Persistence.xml as well as the demonstrational usage of Insert and Select within persistence.


# 02-wednsday-exercises
All steps of the exercise were completed as written in the assignment.

The solution for exercises "Exercise 1: Simple Rest endpoint, Exercise 2: Json endpoint & Exercise 3: Return an object"
can be found under the "02-wednsday-exercises" folder as the project "rest1".

The solution for exercise "Exercise 4: Use JPA with your web service" can be found under the "02-wednsday-exercises" folder 
as a continuation of the project "ExerciseTwo".

The solutions for these exercises covered the term Restfull webservices centring about the conventions in the construction
REST api's and usage of REST endpoints. This included the usage of GET REST annotations, the handling of endpoint parameters
and demonstration of combined JPA/REST project fundamentals.


# 03-thursday-exercises
All steps of the exercise were completed as written in the assignment.

The solution for exercises "Exercise 1: Using the start code, Exercise 2: Create DTO class, Exercise 3: Exposing endpoints &
Exercise 4: Deploy" can be found under the "03-thursday-exercises" folder as the project "week1-simple-jpa-rest_employee".

The project deployment can be found here: http://206.189.55.144:8080/jpa_rest_startup_employee/

The solutions for these exercises covered the design of simple GET-endpoints on the background of underlying database access 
via JPA, as well as the usage of JSON and DTO's for serialisation between Java objects and JSON. This was part of an introduction 
to data object transferal between Java objects and JSON in out own code.


# 04-friday-exercises
All steps of the exercise were completed as written in the assignment.

The solution for exercises "JPA, REST and Data Transfer Objects 1-10 & Deploy your solution 1-6" can be found under 
the "04-friday-exercises" folder as the project "week1-simple-jpa-rest_bank".

The project deployment can be found here: http://206.189.55.144:8080/jpa_rest_startup_bank/

The solutions for these exercises covered a combination of this weeks topics including the basics for ORM frameworks 
and JPA with annotations for persistence of entities in a database as well as REST api's and usage of REST endpoints and
underlying database access via JPA, as well as the usage of JSON and DTO's for serialisation between Java objects 
and JSON. The learning goals of the week have therefore payed their part as fundamentals for these solutions that will
be templates for further work within Object Relational Mapping and REST.
